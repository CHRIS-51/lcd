# lcd
Noah's LCD project.
LCD is the method you use (whether you know it or not!) to find a common denominator when adding fractions with
different denominators. So if you want to add 1/2 + 1/3, how would you do that? First find the LCD, which
is 6, change 1/2 to 3/6, change 1/3 to 2/6, and add. The answer is 5/6. You don’t have to be able to input fractions, just the
different denominators, in this case 2 and 3.
It’s good you made up the algorithm yourself, you just answered a different question.
Do yourself a favor and do NOT look up an algorithm to calculate LCD.
That’s what programming is really about; figuring out how to do something. 
OK - there’s more, but that’s one of the tough/interesting parts. Without thinking about it too much, a negative
fraction will have the same LCD as a positive one, we just put the ‘-‘ sign in the numerator.
Also, 0 is disallowed.
Non-repeating decimals can easily be turned into fractions (as can some repeating decimals) but that’s a different assignment.
Stick with positive integers for now. 

Part b) Allow inputting any number of integers.
